# runescape-scripts
A combination of both my interested: RuneScape and automation. My attempt in creating scripts as human like as possible to avoid tripping that game's bot detection.

> Scripts made using the __AutoIt__ language.

> Additional information about the scripts will be adding upon furthor testing.

### Notes:
1. Screen Resolution: 1920 x 1080
2. OSBuddy as client
3. Client resized to half screen

## Fletching
