# Old School RuneScape (OSRS 2007) Scripts
A combination of both my interested: RuneScape and automation. My attempt in creating scripts as human like as possible to avoid tripping that game's bot detection.

> Scripts made using the __AutoIt__ language.

> Additional information about the scripts will be adding upon furthor testing.

### How it works:
1. Avoids using a custom client
	1. Custom clients are easily detectable
2. Every click has a random delay along with random click in a certain area
	1. This is to simulate human clicks as we never move or click at exact same rates
3. Bot will stop within seconds if it encounters an error
	1. Using pixel search, we can avoid click errors
	2. If what we are looking for isnt found, the bot will stop as if we stopped by afking
4. Clicks are simulated through the computer's mouse
	1. This makes it so there is no mouse 'teleportation'
5. Actions are 1:1
	1. For every input, there is only 1 output
	2. To avoid being accidentally detected as AHK (Auto Hot Keys)

### Notes:
1. Screen Resolution: 1920 x 1080
2. OSBuddy as client
3. Client resized to half screen
